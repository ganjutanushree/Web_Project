## Mobile Responsiveness

This project is fully responsive:
- **Desktop Layout**: Features a 3-column layout with a sidebar, central feed, and a right sidebar.
- **Mobile Layout**: On mobile, only the icons in the sidebar are visible, with the central content taking up most of the screen.

### Media Queries
Media queries have been added to ensure the layout adjusts properly:

- **480px** and below: Optimized for small screens, ensuring a clean and functional design.

## Future Enhancements

- **JavaScript Functionality**: Add dynamic features like tweet posting, like button, and retweets.
- **Backend Integration**: Set up a database and user authentication to make it a functional web application.
- **Animations**: Improve user interactions with smooth animations on hover and click events.
